/** \mainpage Threads Documentation

The Threads project provides several systems for convenient thread usage:

1. Thread Base
   - A foundational class for creating custom thread-based components.

2. Logger
   - Built upon the reusable thread base, providing efficient logging capabilities.

3. Thread Pool
   - Implements a pool of worker threads, also based on the reusable thread base.

In addition to these core components, this project includes sample code demonstrating how to effectively utilize these systems in your applications.

For detailed information on each component and usage examples, please refer to the respective sections in this documentation.
