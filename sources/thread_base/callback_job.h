	 * @class callback_job
	 * @brief A specialized job class that encapsulates a user-defined callback.
	 *
	 * The @c callback_job class provides an interface for executing a user-supplied
	 * function within a job queue. The callback function returns an @c std::optional<std::string>,
	 * where a value (string) typically indicates an error message and @c std::nullopt signifies
	 * a successful operation.
	 *
	 * Usage Example:
	 * @code
	 * auto job = std::make_shared<callback_job>(
	 *     []() -> std::optional<std::string> {
	 *         // Perform some work here...
	 *         bool success = do_some_work();
	 *         if (!success) {
	 *             return std::string{"Work failed due to ..."};
	 *         }
	 *         return std::nullopt; // No error => success
	 *     },
	 *     "example_callback_job"
	 * );
	 * // Submit job to a queue or execute it directly...
	 * @endcode

		 *                 - Returns a @c std::string on failure (the string can be treated as
		 *                   an error message or diagnostic detail).
		 * @param name     An optional name for this job (default is "callback_job").
