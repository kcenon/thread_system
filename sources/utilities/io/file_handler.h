	 * @class file
	 * @brief A utility class for basic file I/O operations.
	 *
	 * The @c file class provides static methods for:
	 * - Removing files from the filesystem.
	 * - Reading file contents into a byte buffer.
	 * - Saving (overwriting) data to a file.
	 * - Appending data to existing files.
	 *
	 * Under the hood, it uses standard C++ file streams (and possibly @c std::filesystem features,
	 * if available) to manage file paths and I/O operations. Each method returns an optional
	 * error message:
	 * - @c std::nullopt indicates success.
	 * - A non-empty @c std::string indicates the reason why the operation failed.
	 *
	 * ### Example Usage
	 * @code
	 * // Remove a file
	 * if (auto err = file::remove("data.bin")) {
	 *     std::cerr << "Failed to remove file: " << *err << std::endl;
	 * }
	 *
	 * // Load file into memory
	 * auto [contents, load_err] = file::load("image.png");
	 * if (load_err) {
	 *     std::cerr << "Failed to load file: " << *load_err << std::endl;
	 * } else {
	 *     // Use contents...
	 * }
	 *
	 * // Save data
	 * std::vector<uint8_t> data = {0x01, 0x02, 0x03};
	 * if (auto err = file::save("output.bin", data)) {
	 *     std::cerr << "Failed to save file: " << *err << std::endl;
	 * }
	 * @endcode
