	 * @class datetime_tool
	 * @brief A utility class offering date/time formatting and time difference calculations.
	 *
	 * The @c datetime_tool class provides static methods to:
	 * - Format date and time from @c std::chrono::system_clock::time_point into human-readable
	 * strings.
	 * - Extract sub-second units (milliseconds, microseconds, nanoseconds).
	 * - Compute time differences between two time points in various duration units.
	 *
	 * ### Typical Usage
	 * @code
	 * auto now = std::chrono::system_clock::now();
	 * std::string date_str = datetime_tool::date(now);        // e.g. "2025-02-13"
	 * std::string time_str = datetime_tool::time(now);        // e.g. "12:34:56"
	 * std::string ms_str   = datetime_tool::milliseconds(now);// e.g. "123"
	 * auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
	 * // ... do some work ...
	 * double duration_ms = datetime_tool::time_difference<>(start); // Default = milliseconds
	 * std::cout << "Elapsed ms: " << duration_ms << std::endl;
	 * @endcode
