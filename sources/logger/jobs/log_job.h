	 *        a concurrent job system.
	 *
	 * The @c log_job class extends the base @c job class to provide specialized handling
	 * for logging operations. Each @c log_job stores a message in one of several string
	 * encodings, along with optional metadata such as log type (e.g., info, warning, error)
	 * and timing information. When executed, it converts the message into a standardized
	 * format (including timestamps) and makes it available for output.
	 *
	 * This design enables asynchronous or concurrent logging, allowing the main application
	 * threads to enqueue log messages for later processing, thus avoiding potential
	 * performance bottlenecks.
