	 * @brief Represents a console logging job derived from the base job class.
	 *
	 * This class encapsulates the functionality for creating and executing
	 * console logging operations as jobs within a job system (e.g., a thread pool).
	 * It primarily handles the process of writing log messages to standard output,
	 * making it easier to manage logging in a multi-threaded environment.
	 *
	 * Example usage:
	 * @code
	 * // Create a message_job instance
	 * auto my_log_job = std::make_shared<message_job>(
	 *     log_types::info,
	 *     "2025-02-14 10:00:00",
	 *     "This is an informational message."
	 * );
	 *
	 * // Submit the job to a job system or thread pool
	 * job_system.submit(my_log_job);
	 * @endcode
