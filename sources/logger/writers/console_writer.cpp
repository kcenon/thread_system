/**
 * @file console_writer.cpp
 * @brief Implementation of console output writer for log messages.
 *
 * This file contains the implementation of the console_writer class, which outputs
 * formatted log messages to the console (stdout). The writer processes message jobs
 * asynchronously and provides formatted console output with timestamps and log levels.
 * 
 * Key Features:
 * - Asynchronous console output using dedicated worker thread
 * - Batch processing for efficient console I/O operations
 * - Formatted output with timestamps and log level indicators
 * - Cross-platform formatting support (std::format or fmt library)
 * - Buffer optimization for reduced console write operations
 * 
 * Output Format:
 * - With log type: "[timestamp][log_type] message"
 * - Without log type: "[timestamp] message"
 * - Automatic newline handling for proper console display
 * 
 * Performance Optimizations:
 * - Message batching reduces console write system calls
 * - String buffer accumulation minimizes I/O overhead
 * - Conditional compilation for optimal formatting library
 * - Efficient string building using back_inserter
 * 
 * Thread Safety:
 * - Console output serialized through single writer thread
 * - Message queue provides thread-safe job submission
 * - No concurrent console access conflicts
