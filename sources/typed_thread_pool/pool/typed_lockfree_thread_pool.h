	 * @class typed_lockfree_thread_pool_t
	 * @brief A lock-free thread pool that schedules and executes jobs based on their priority levels.
	 *
	 * @tparam job_type The type representing job types (e.g., enum or integral type).
	 * @ingroup thread_pools
	 *
	 * The typed_lockfree_thread_pool_t template class provides a lock-free thread pool implementation 
	 * that processes jobs according to their assigned types rather than just submission order.
	 * This implementation uses typed_lockfree_job_queue for high-performance concurrent operations.
	 *
	 * ### Key Features
	 * - **Lock-Free Operations**: Uses typed_lockfree_job_queue for scalable performance
	 * - **Type-Based Scheduling**: Jobs with higher priority are processed first.
	 * - **Customizable Type Types**: Supports custom priority types through templates.
	 * - **Worker Thread Model**: Each worker runs in its own thread, processing jobs.
	 * - **Dynamic Thread Management**: Add/remove workers at runtime.
	 * - **Graceful Shutdown**: Option to complete current jobs before stopping.
	 *
	 * ### Performance Benefits
	 * - No mutex contention in job queue operations
	 * - Better scalability with increasing thread counts
	 * - Lower latency for high-priority job processing
	 * - Reduced context switching overhead
