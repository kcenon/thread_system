/**
 * @file thread_worker.cpp
 * @brief Implementation of worker thread for thread pool execution.
 *
 * This file contains the implementation of the thread_worker class, which represents
 * individual worker threads within a thread pool. Each worker thread continuously
 * processes jobs from a shared job queue until the thread pool is shut down.
 * 
 * Key Features:
 * - Continuous job processing from shared queue
 * - Optional performance timing and logging
 * - Graceful shutdown handling
 * - Error propagation and logging
 * - Job queue association management
 * 
 * Worker Lifecycle:
 * 1. Worker is created and associated with a job queue
 * 2. Worker thread starts and enters continuous work loop
 * 3. Worker dequeues and executes jobs until queue is empty/stopped
 * 4. Worker logs execution results and timing information
 * 5. Worker shuts down gracefully when work is complete
 * 
 * Performance Characteristics:
 * - Low latency job pickup (typically <1¬µs)
 * - Efficient queue polling with minimal CPU overhead
 * - Optional timing measurements for performance analysis

	 * - Initializes timing flag for optional performance measurement
	 * - Job queue is not set initially (must be set before starting work)
	 * - Stores thread context for logging and monitoring

	/**
	 * @brief Determines if the worker should continue processing jobs.
	 *
	 * Implementation details:
	 * - Used by thread_base to control the work loop
	 * - Returns false if no job queue is set (prevents infinite loop)
	 * - Returns true while queue is not stopped (even if empty)
	 * - Actual job waiting is handled by non-blocking polling in do_work()
	 * - Thread-safe operation (job_queue methods are thread-safe)
	 *
	 * Work Loop Control:
	 * - Worker continues until queue is explicitly stopped
	 * - Empty queue does NOT cause worker exit - do_work() will poll for jobs
	 * - This prevents premature worker termination before jobs arrive
	 * - Worker exits gracefully only when queue is stopped
	 *
	 * Design Rationale - Solving the Two-Level Condition Variable Problem:
	 * - Thread_base waits on its own condition variable (worker_condition_)
	 * - Job_queue notifies its own condition variable (different object!)
	 * - If should_continue_work() returns false on empty queue:
	 *   1. thread_base waits on worker_condition_
	 *   2. job enqueue notifies job_queue's condition variable
	 *   3. Worker never wakes up - deadlock situation
	 *
	 * - By returning true until stopped, worker enters do_work() immediately
	 * - do_work() uses non-blocking try_dequeue() with polling
	 * - This completely avoids the two-level CV problem
	 * - CPU overhead is minimal due to sleep between polling attempts
	 *
	 * Shutdown Safety:
	 * - thread_pool::stop() can call operations in any order without race conditions
	 * - Queue stop sets is_stopped() = true (atomic operation)
	 * - Worker sees stopped flag and exits cleanly
	 * - No dependency on operation ordering
	 *
	 * @return true if worker should continue processing, false to exit

	/**
	 * @brief Executes a single work cycle by processing one job from the queue.
	 *
	 * Implementation details:
	 * - Uses non-blocking try_dequeue() to avoid condition variable deadlock
	 * - Polls the queue with minimal CPU overhead via short sleep intervals
	 * - Validates job pointer before execution
	 * - Optionally measures execution timing for performance analysis
	 * - Associates job with queue for potential re-submission
	 * - Logs execution results with appropriate detail level
	 *
	 * Job Processing Workflow:
	 * 1. Validate job queue availability
	 * 2. Attempt non-blocking dequeue of next job
	 * 3. If queue is empty: sleep briefly and return (will be called again)
	 * 4. Validate dequeued job pointer
	 * 5. Optionally record start time for measurement
	 * 6. Associate job with queue for context
	 * 7. Execute job's do_work() method
	 * 8. Handle execution errors with detailed logging
	 * 9. Log successful completion with timing info if enabled
	 *
	 * Non-Blocking Polling Strategy:
	 * - Uses try_dequeue() instead of blocking dequeue()
	 * - Avoids two-level condition variable problem completely
	 * - When queue is empty: sleeps 100Œºs to prevent CPU spinning
	 * - Returns success immediately, will be called again by thread_base loop
	 * - should_continue_work() determines when to exit (on queue stop)
	 *
	 * Performance Characteristics:
	 * - Zero blocking on condition variables (no CV synchronization)
	 * - Minimal CPU overhead: 100Œºs sleep when idle
	 * - Fast job pickup when available: <1Œºs typical latency
	 * - Predictable behavior independent of queue notification timing
	 *
	 * Error Handling:
	 * - Missing job queue: Returns resource allocation error
	 * - Empty queue: Returns success after brief sleep (normal polling)
	 * - Null job pointer: Returns job invalid error
	 * - Job execution failure: Returns execution failed error with details
	 *
	 * Performance Measurements:
	 * - High-resolution timing when use_time_tag_ is enabled
	 * - Nanosecond precision for accurate profiling
	 * - Minimal overhead when timing is disabled
	 *
	 * Logging Behavior:
	 * - Standard success message when timing is disabled
	 * - Timestamped success message when timing is enabled
	 * - Error details are propagated up the call stack
	 *
	 * @return result_void indicating success or detailed error information
