## Quick Start & Usage Examples

### üöÄ **Getting Started in 5 Minutes**

```cpp
#include "priority_thread_pool.h"
using namespace priority_thread_pool_module;

// 1. Create a priority thread pool
auto pool = std::make_shared<priority_thread_pool_t<job_priorities>>();

// 2. Add workers with different responsibilities
pool->add_worker(job_priorities::High);      // High priority specialist
pool->add_worker({job_priorities::High, job_priorities::Normal}); // Multi-priority worker

// 3. Start processing
pool->start();

// 4. Submit jobs with priorities
pool->enqueue(make_priority_job([]() { 
    // Your high-priority task here
}, job_priorities::High));

// 5. Clean shutdown
pool->stop();
```
